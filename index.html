            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p> Born in 1980 in Prague, Petr Bakla often employs basic pitch-based material (typically the chromatic and the whole-tone scales) in his compositions.<br> He is interested in constructing situations and structural contexts in which these frugal musical elements can acquire a unique expressiveness and energy.<br> A frequent feature of Bakla's work is a simultaneous course of two musical/sound layers which, although usually markedly differing in dynamics to allow<br> for a sense of "figure and background", are not mutually subordinating - they are of equal importance, their "friction" creating specific tension and ambiguity.</p>
